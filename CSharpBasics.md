C# Essential 1:


**C# interactive - Getting Started**
1. to get the result of an expression, dont end the line with ;

*Declaring variables:*
2. implicit typing- supports untyped or weakly typed language

``` eg., var stringFirst = "This is a String";
      stringFirst
	"This is a String"
```
3. unlike weak typing language (JS) "" represents string and '' represents char

*Built-in data types:*
primitive types: types that cannot be deconstructed into 
4. int - signed integer
   uint - unsigned integer (double the max value to use larger positive integer value)
   
 ```
 eg., >int bigInt = int.MAX_VALUE;
      >uint positiveInt = uint.MAX_VALUE;
      >bigInt
      2147483647
      >positiveInt
      4294967295
```
short, long, float
5. convert ambiguous assignment to unambiguous.
```
>float pie = 3.14;
error: literal of type double cannot be implicitly converted to type 'float'
>float pie = 3.14f;
```
*Everything is an Object:*

6. all data types are treated as an Object with collection of static and member variables
```
 >int.Parse("15")
 15
 >var test ="abcde";
 >test.ToUpper()
 "ABCDE"
``` 
*Working with Strings:*

7. Trim,TrimEnd,TrimeStart
8. ToUpper(),ToLower()
challenge: 
uppercase string begining at 24 to second attribute from end
remove trailing or leading spaces.
```
> var challenge ="  Text processing in C# is really great  ";
>challenge.Trim().SubString(24, challenge.Trim().Length-25).ToUpper().Trim()
"REALLY GREAT"
>
```
9. String concatenation - 
```
      >var sb = new StringBuilder();
      >sb.Append("aa");
      >sb.Append("bb");
      >sb.ToString()
      "aabb"
      >sb =new StringBuilder();
      >sb.AppendLine("aabb");
      >sb.AppendLine("dsfgdfG");
      >sb.ToString()
      "aabb\r\ndsfgdfG\r\n"
```
10. string formatter- string.Format()
format string with locale setting

11.PArsing strings
```
    >int.Parse("14")
    14
    >int.Parse("12,234")
    Input string was not in a correct format..

    >var test = "12,234";
    >int.Parse(test.Replace(",",""))
    12234
```

int.TryParse(str,out)- will attempt to parse, if it fails exception is not thrown. uniqueness of TryParse() is its return has two parts.
out variable is set in case of successful execution of TryParse(). it returns a boolean and its out variable holds int.

```
   >int result;
   >int.TryParse("12,234",out result)
   false
   >result
   0
   >int.TryParse("12234",out result)
   true
   >result
   12234
```
*Math in C#:*

12. +,-,*,/,%,++,-- operators and other Math functions like abs,pow,round,floor,ceiling

*Constants and enumeration*

13. constants - const float pi =3.14f;
```
>enum weekDays {Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday };
>var someDays = weekDays.Monday;
```
we can also set the value of each item in enum explicitly like Monday=1, Tuesday=3..

*Date and Time*

14. DateTime.Now -	current date and time
    TimeSpan - is used for arithmetic operations
    
    ```
    >var birthday = new DateTime(1967,10,2);
    >var difference = DateTime.Now - birthday;
    >difference
    [18455:34:34:33.23246510]
    >difference.Days
    18023
    ```
    gives the number days on earth since birth for a birthdate
    
    ```
    >var dateTime = new DateTime(2010,10,18,9,51,32);
    ```
    dateTime.AddMinute() - positive number indicates addition, negative number indicates subtraction
    dateTime.ToFileTime() - outputs a timestamp for file processing
    dateTime.ToLongDateString()

**Working with Classes**

1. Creating a class
	File>New>Project -> ClassLibrary(.dll) - VC++
2. Namespaces
	similar to package in Java
3. Auto-properties - Automatic property in C# is a property that has backing field generated by compiler. It saves developers from writing primitive getters and setters that just return value of backing field or assign to it
```
public class Dummy
{
    private string _name;//backing field
 
    public string Name
    {
        get { return _name;  }
        set { _name = value;  }
    }
}
```
can be written as
```
public class Dummy
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
}
```
4. Backing field - getter setter
5. Encapsulation and access specifier

    public  - seen outside of the class
    private - seen inside of the class
    protected
    internal
    
6. Constructor
	- run immediately when an object is instantiated.
	Hint: editor trick enter 'ctor' and hit tab key twice - creates the default constructor for the class
	constructor access specifier - public
	
7. Creating Methods
	*Common Method block*
	```
	public float AverageOfThreeNumbers(float a, float b, float c){
		return (a+b+c)/3;
	}
	```
	*Function bodied expressions* (new in C# 6)
		- simple method can be concisely written using function bodied expression.
	```
	public float AverageOfThreeNumbers(float a, float b, float c) => (a+b+c)/3;
	```
	*static Methods* - used without instantiation
	

*4. Object-Oriented Features:*
